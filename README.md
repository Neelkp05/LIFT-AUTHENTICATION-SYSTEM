RFID-Based Lift Authentication System
Welcome to the RFID-Based Lift Authentication System repository! This project implements a secure access control system for elevators using RFID technology. Built on the ESP32 microcontroller and leveraging FreeRTOS, the system ensures real-time, reliable authentication in multi-user environments. Authentication logs are visualized on the cloud via ThingSpeak for monitoring and analysis. This repository includes hardware schematics, Arduino IDE-compatible C code, and detailed documentation, making it suitable for residential, commercial, and high-security applications.
